- An effective website design should fulfil its intended function by conveying its particular message whilst simultaneously engaging the visitor.

- Several factors such as consistency, colors, typography, imagery, simplicity, and functionality contribute to good website design.

- **Website purpose**

There are many different purposes that websites may have but there are core purposes common to all websites;

	1. Describing Expertise

	2. Building Your Reputation

	3. Generating Leads

	4. Sales and After Care

- **Simplicity**

Simplicity is the best way to go when considering the user experience and the usability of your website.

- **Navigation**

Website navigation is key to retaining visitors. If the website navigation is confusing visitors will give up and find what they need elsewhere. Keeping navigation simple, intuitive and consistent on every page is key.

- **F-Shaped Pattern Reading**

The F- based pattern is the most common way visitors scan text on a website. Eye-tracking studies have found that most of what people see is in the top and left areas of the screen.

- **Visual Hierarchy**

One of the most important functions of visual hierarchy is to establish a focal point; this shows visitors where the most important information is.

- **Content**

An effective website has both great design and great content. Using compelling language great content can attract and influence visitors by converting them into customers.

- **Grid Based Layout**

The grid helps to align elements on the page and keep it clean. The grid-based layout arranges content into a clean rigid grid structure with columns, sections that line up and feel balanced and impose order and results in an aesthetically pleasing website.

- **Load time**

Waiting for a website to load will lose visitors. Nearly half of web visitors expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less and they will potentially leave a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds.

- **Mobile friendly**

More people are using their phones or other devices to browse the web. It is important to consider building your website with a responsive layout where your website can adjust to different screens.

### Web Page

A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. These are also often called just "pages." A **web page** is a simple document displayable by a browser. Such are written in the HTML language.

### Website

A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often called a "website" or a "site."

A *website* is a collection of linked web pages (plus their associated resources) that share a unique domain name. Each web page of a given website provides explicit links—most of the time in the form of clickable portions of text—that allow the user to move from one page of the website to another.

### Web Server

A *web server* is a computer hosting one or more *websites*. "Hosting" means that all the *web pages* and their supporting files are available on that computer. The *web server* will send any *web page* from the *website* it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request.

### Web Application

A web application (web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the internet through a browser interface. Web services are web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain web apps.
