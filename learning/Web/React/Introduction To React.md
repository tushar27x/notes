- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It is used to build single page applications
 - A single page application is a web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current webpage with new data from the web server instead of the default method of web browser loading entire new pages.
- It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- It allows us to create a web application by the means of reusable components.

## Working

- React apps are made out of `components`
- `Component` is a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance.
- A component can be as small as a button or as large as the entire page.
- Instead of manipulating the real DOM (Document Object Model), react creates its own virtual DOM where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes int the browser DOM.
- React finds what changes have been made by the client and changes only what needs to be changed, i.e. instead of re-rendering the whole application only the components that need to updated are changed.
