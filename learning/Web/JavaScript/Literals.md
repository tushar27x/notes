- In JavaScript, literals are fixed values that are directly written into your code. They are not stored in variables but are rather directly used to represent data.
- You can use different literals to represent various data types in JavaScript. They offer a simple and direct way to express data without needing to perform intricate calculations or external requests

```javascript
const num = 42; // Numeric literal

const str = 'Hello'; // String literal

const bool = true; // Boolean literal

const arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Array literal

const obj = { name: 'John', age: 30 }; // Object literal

const regex = /pattern/; // Regular expression literal

const templateStr = `Hello, ${name}!`; // Template literal
```
