| It was introduced in 2009.                                                                                                                  | It was introduced in 2015.                                                                                                                 |
| It supports primitive data types that are string, number, Boolean, null, and undefined.                                                     | In ES6, there are some additions to JavaScript data types. It introduced a new primitive data type ‘symbol’ for supporting unique values.  |
| There is only one way to define the variables by using the var keyword.                                                                     | There are two new ways to define variables that are let and const.                                                                         |
| It has a lower performance as compared to ES6.                                                                                              | It has a higher performance than ES5.                                                                                                      |
| Object manipulation is time-consuming in ES5.                                                                                               | Object manipulation is less time-consuming in ES6.                                                                                         |
| In ES5, both function and return keywords are used to define a function.                                                                    | An arrow function is a new feature introduced in ES6 by which we don’t require the function keyword to define the function.                |
| It provides a larger range of community support than that of ES6                                                                            | It provides a smaller range of community support than ES5.                                                                                 |
