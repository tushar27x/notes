## Introduction

- Node.js is an open source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- It runs of the V8 JavaScript Engine.
- Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.\
- In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers.
