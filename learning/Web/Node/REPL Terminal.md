- Node.js runtime has a built-in interactive shell, which you can execute statements one at a time.
- This shell works on the principle of **REPL** which is an acronym for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop.
	- *Read* -> read user input, parse the input into JavaScript data structure and store it in memory.
	- *Eval* -> Takes and evaluates the data structure.
	- *Print* -> print the result.
	- *Loop* -> terminal is ready to receive next input.
