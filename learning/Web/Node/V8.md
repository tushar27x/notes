- Â V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in 2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded, V8 became the engine that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in JavaScript.
-  Other JS engines include:
	- Firefox uses `SpiderMonkey`
	- Safari uses `JavaScriptCore` (also called `Nitro`).
	- Edge used `Chakra` in the past but now uses `V8` .
- V8 is written in `C++` 
- It is portable and runs on MacOS, Windows and Linux.
- JavaScript is generally considered to be **interpreted** language but modern JavaScript Engines no longer just interpret JavaScript they **compile** it.
- JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with **just-in-time** (JIT) **compilation** to speed up execution.
