- It is a NoSQL database that was developed based on Apache Lucene search engine.
- It can be used to index and store multiple different types of documents and data.

### Nodes
- A node is a single server which is a part of cluster, stores data and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities.

### Cluster
 - A cluster is a collection of one or more nodes that, together, holds the entire data.

### Index
- An index is a collection of documents with similar characteristics and is identified by a name.

### Document
- A document is a basic unit of information which can be indexed. It is expressed in JSON which is an ubiquitous internet data interchange format.

### Shards
- Elasticsearch provides the ability to subdivide the index into multiple pieces called shards.
- Each shard is in itself a fully-functional and independent “index” that can be hosted on any node within the cluster.

### Replicas
- Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards which are called replica shards or replica.
