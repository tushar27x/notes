- The Linux filesystem is the collection of files on your machine. It includes the files needed to run the machine and applications as well as your own files containing your work.
- The top level of the filesystem is the root directory, symbolized by a forward slash `/`.
- Below this is a tree-like structure of the directories and files in the system. 
- The filesystem assigns appropriate access rights to the directories and files.
- The very top of the Linux filesystem is the root directory, which contains many other directories and files. 


### `/bin`
- One of the key directories is `/bin`, which contains user binary files. 
- Binary files contain the code your machine reads to run programs and execute commands.
- Itâ€™s called "slash bin" to signify that it exists directly below the root directory.

### `/usr`
- Other key directories include `/usr`, which contains user programs,

### `/home`
- which is your personal working directory where you should store all your personal files,

### `/boot`
- contains system boot files

### `/media`
