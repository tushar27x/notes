It is an extension of Continuous Integration.
The goal of CI is to detect any defects at very early stage so it does not multiply.

We have to understand that in agile development, there will be regular code changes which needs to be deployed on servers for further testing.

Deployment is not just about shipping the software to the servers. It's more than that. A deployment could mean also server provisioning, installing dependencies on servers, configuration changes, network or firewall rules changes, and then deploy the artifact to the server and there could be many more things.

So Ops team, will write automation code for deployment testers will write automation code for software testing and sync it with developers source code.

So now we have a process integrated with deployment automation, which triggers software testing, all

three teams and processes integrated together.
