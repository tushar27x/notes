**Deployment strategies and techniques** ensure that new versions of software are rolled out to production efficiently, with minimal downtime and risk to users. These strategies vary based on application needs, business requirements, and the level of risk tolerance.

### **Key Deployment Strategies**

#### 1. **Recreate Deployment**

- **Description**: The existing version of the application is shut down entirely before the new version is deployed.
- **Use Case**: Simple applications without strict uptime requirements.
- **Pros**:
    - Straightforward and easy to implement.
- **Cons**:
    - Causes downtime during deployment.
    - No rollback without another downtime.

---

#### 2. **Rolling Deployment**

- **Description**: Instances of the old version are replaced with the new version incrementally.
- **Use Case**: Applications with multiple instances and no strict need for instant full deployment.
- **Pros**:
    - No downtime as traffic is gradually switched.
    - Easier to identify issues early.
- **Cons**:
    - Difficult to roll back fully in case of failure.
    - Temporary coexistence of versions may cause compatibility issues.

---

#### 3. **Blue-Green Deployment**

- **Description**: Two environments (blue and green) are maintained. One runs the current version, while the other is prepared with the new version. Traffic switches entirely once the new version is verified.
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring minimal risk and near-zero downtime.
- **Pros**:
    - Instant rollback possible by switching traffic back.
    - No downtime for users.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires duplicate infrastructure, increasing costs.

---

#### 4. **Canary Deployment**

- **Description**: A new version is released to a small subset of users initially. If no issues are detected, the deployment is gradually expanded.
- **Use Case**: Applications with a large user base and need for incremental testing.
- **Pros**:
    - Limits exposure to issues initially.
    - Allows real-world validation before full rollout.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires monitoring tools to detect issues.
    - Complex to implement effectively.

#### 5. **Shadow Deployment**

- **Description**: The new version runs in parallel to the old one, but user traffic is mirrored (not routed) to the new version for testing.
- **Use Case**: Testing new versions under real-world conditions without impacting users.
- **Pros**:
    - Detects issues without affecting users.
- **Cons**:
    - High resource usage for maintaining parallel environments.

---

#### 6. **Feature Toggles (Feature Flags)**

- **Description**: Features are toggled on or off dynamically without redeploying the application. This allows gradual activation of new functionality.
- **Use Case**: Releasing incomplete or experimental features to specific users.
- **Pros**:
    - Fine-grained control over feature rollout.
    - Rollback involves toggling features off, not redeployment.
- **Cons**:
    - Adds complexity to the codebase.

---

#### 7. **A/B Testing**

- **Description**: Different versions (A and B) are released to subsets of users to compare performance or user behavior.
- **Use Case**: Validating changes in user-facing applications.
- **Pros**:
    - Provides data-driven insights.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires infrastructure for traffic splitting and data analysis.

---

#### 8. **Progressive Delivery**

- **Description**: Combines canary deployments with feature flags, enabling gradual rollouts and dynamic feature control.
- **Use Case**: Complex systems with frequent updates.
- **Pros**:
    - Reduces risk while allowing flexibility.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires robust automation and monitoring.

### **Key Techniques Supporting Deployment Strategies**

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
    - Tools like Terraform, Ansible, and AWS CloudFormation automate environment setup and scaling.
2. **Containerization**:
    - Tools like Docker and Kubernetes make deployments consistent across environments.
3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and Datadog help monitor deployments and detect issues.
4. **Load Balancing**:
    - Directs user traffic during phased rollouts (e.g., NGINX, AWS Elastic Load Balancing).
5. **Rollback Mechanisms**:
    - Automate rolling back to a previous version if the new deployment fails.
