In the **UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)** network, channels are essential for communication between the **User Equipment (UE)** and the **UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network)**. These channels are categorized into logical, transport, and physical channels, each serving specific purposes in the communication process.

|**Type**|**Examples**|**Function**|
|---|---|---|
|Logical Channels|BCCH, DCCH, DTCH|Define the type of information.|
|Transport Channels|RACH, FACH, DCH|Define how the information is delivered.|
|Physical Channels|P-CCPCH, SCH, DPDCH|Represent the actual radio transmission.|

### **Logical Channels**

- Define the type of information being sent. 
- Categorized as 
	1. Control Channel - Used for signaling and control information
	2. Traffic Channel - used for user data.

### **Transport channel**

- Transport channels define how data is transferred over the air interface. They handle the mapping of logical channels onto the physical channels.

### **Physical Channels**

- Physical channels represent the actual transmission on the radio interface. They correspond to the physical resources like time slots, spreading codes, and frequencies.


### **Relationship Between Channels**

1. **Logical Channels** map to **Transport Channels** based on the type of service or information.
2. **Transport Channels** are further mapped to **Physical Channels**, which define the actual radio transmission.
3. Examples:  
- **BCCH (Logical)** → **BCH (Transport)** → **P-CCPCH (Physical)**
- **DTCH (Logical)** → **DCH (Transport)** → **DPDCH + DPCCH (Physical)**
