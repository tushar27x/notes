#### **GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)**
- GPRS, known as a "2.5G" technology, enabled packet-switched data services, allowing mobile devices to connect to the internet and send/receive data in packets, as opposed to circuit-switched data used in voice communication.
- It is an overlay on the existing GSM infrastructure and includes additional components for data handling. The main components are:
	- **Mobile Station (MS)**: The user device that initiates the connection.
	- **Base Station Subsystem (BSS)**: The existing GSM base station is used to transmit data between the MS and the network.
	- **Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)**: Responsible for packet data delivery to and from the MS. It manages mobile device data sessions, tracks the user’s location, and handles mobility.
	- **Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)**: Connects the GPRS network to external networks, such as the internet. It routes data between the mobile network and the external data network.

- The combination of SGSN and GGSN enables the packet-switched data capabilities, creating a more efficient system than the circuit-switched connections used in traditional GSM networks.
##### GPRS Network Nodes

1. **PCU (Packet Control Unit)**: Handles packet data at the BSS level, controlling packet switching.
2. **HLR (Home Location Register)**: Stores user data, including the mobile station’s IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) and location data.
3. **VLR (Visitor Location Register)**: Temporarily holds data for roaming users within the network area.
4. **Firewall**: Protects the GPRS network from unauthorized access and secures data packets.

### **Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)**

EDGE, also known as 2.75G, is an enhancement to GPRS that improves data speeds by using a more advanced modulation technique called **8-PSK (Phase Shift Keying)**. EDGE provides higher data rates, up to around 384 kbps, which enabled better browsing and multimedia capabilities on mobile devices.

### **Mobile IP**

Mobile IP allows devices to move between different networks while maintaining a constant IP address, providing seamless connectivity as a user moves from one network area to another. This is essential for mobile devices to stay connected without losing sessions or connections.

- **Home Agent (HA)**: A router in the home network that retains the permanent IP address of the device and forwards data packets to the foreign network.
- **Foreign Agent (FA)**: Provides a temporary IP address to the mobile device and forwards data between the home network and the mobile device.

Mobile IP paved the way for smoother roaming experiences and seamless internet connectivity across different network zones.
