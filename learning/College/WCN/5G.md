### **5G Network Architecture**

The 5G network architecture consists of **three main components**:

 **1. 5G Radio Access Network (RAN)**

- Uses **massive MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)** technology to support the high data rates and capacity required by 5G.
- **Small Cells** and **Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS)** are used to improve coverage and capacity, especially in dense urban environments.

**2. 5G Core Network**

- Built around a **cloud-native architecture** that supports flexibility and scalability.
- The 5G core network is based on a **service-based architecture (SBA)** and uses **NFV (Network Function Virtualization)** and **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)** to enable dynamic service delivery.
- Introduces **control plane/user plane separation**, which improves network flexibility and performance.
	
**3. Backhaul and Transport Network**

- Uses **fiber-optic connections** or **millimeter-wave links** to connect the 5G RAN to the core network, supporting ultra-high bandwidth and low latency.
