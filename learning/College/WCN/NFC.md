- Stands for Near Field Communication.
- Wireless technology that enables communication between devices over a distance of 4 cm.
- Requires at least one transmitting device and one receiving device.
- NFC relies on inductive coupling between two electromagnetic coils present on NFC-enabled devices

### **Types of NFC devices**

1. **Passive NFC devices**
	- These near-field communication devices include tags and other small transmitters that can send information to other NFC devices without the need for a power source of their own.
	- These devices donâ€™t really process any information sent from other sources, and can not connect to other passive components.

2. **Active NFC devices**
	- These near-field communication devices can do both things i.e. send and receive data.
	- They can communicate with each other as well as with passive devices.
	- Smartphones are the best example of active NFC devices. Card readers in public transport and touch payment terminals are also good examples of the technology.


### **Working**

NFC standard currently has 3 working modes.
1. **Peer-to-Peer Mode**: In this mode exchange of information is allowed between 2 devices. Both the devices are active NFC devices.
2. **Read/Write mode**: It is one way data transmission. The active device, possibly your smartphone, links up with another device in order to read information from it.
3. **Emulation**: The NFC device can function as a smart or contactless credit card and make payments or tap into public transport systems.

| **Range**               | Short (up to 10 cm)                                   | Long (up to 10 meters)                                                            |
| **Data transfer speed** | Slower (up to 424 kbit/s)                             | Faster (up to 2.1 Mbit/s for Bluetooth 2.1 and 1 Mbit/s for Bluetooth Low Energy) |
| **Connectivity**        | Faster (less than 1s to establish a connection)       | Slower (may require manual pairing                                                |
| **Suitable for**        | Passive devices like tags and advertising signs       | File transfers, sharing connections to speakers, and more                         |
| **Applications**        | Mobile payments (Samsung Pay, Android Pay, Apple Pay) | File sharing, music streaming, connecting devices                                 |
