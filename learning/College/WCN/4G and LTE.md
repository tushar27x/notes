- The 4th generation of mobile network introduced significant advancements in mobile communication.
- It is based on **LTE( Long Term Evolution)** and **VoLTE(Voice over LTE)** adding high-quality voice services over the same IP-based infrastructure.

### **Features of 4G LTE**
 -  High Data speeds 
 - All IP based network
 - Low latency
 - Carrier Aggregation (Combines multiple frequency bands to achieve higher throughput and spectral efficiency.)
 - OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)
 - MIMO(Multiple Input and Multiple Output)

### **Features of 4G VoLTE**
- High Quality voice calls
- Faster call setup time
- Improved Spectral Efficiency
- Better Battery life
- Support for emergency services
- Seamless


### **Comparison of LTE and VoLTE**

| **Feature**         | **LTE**                      | **VoLTE**                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Use**     | High-speed data transmission | High-quality voice services over LTE  |
| **Infrastructure**  | IP-based                     | IP-based with IMS                     |
| **Voice Support**   | Not inherently supported     | Fully supported                       |
| **Call Quality**    | N/A                          | HD Voice                              |
| **Call Setup Time** | N/A                          | Much faster than traditional networks |
