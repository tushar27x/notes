- Superposition of multiple signals at the receiver causes random amplitude variation which is known as Fading. A mechanism that is used to decrease the effect of fading is called Diversity.
- It is used to compensate for fading channel impairments.
- In Diversity mechanism, multiple copies of the same data are transmitted to the receiver through multiple paths or channels and the decision is made by the receiver without knowing the transmitter.

### **Types of Diversity**

1. **Space Diversity**
	- Replica of same signal is transmitted through different antenna.
	- Space diversity may give a path that avoid shadowing and also decrease the large scale fading.
	- Space diversity offer different path without an increase in transmitter power or bandwidth.
2. **Time Diversity**
	- Time diversity is obtained by re-transmitting the same signal at separate interval of time.
	- Time Diversity also does not require any increase in the transmission power.
3. **Frequency Diversity**
	- Transmits the signal over multiple frequency bands to reduce the likelihood of simultaneous fading across all frequencies.
	- In Frequency Diversity only one Â antenna is needed. It requires large bandwidth and more number of receivers hence high cost.
4. **Polarization Diversity**
	- Polarization Diversity require two transmitter and two receiving antennas with different polarization.
	- The transmission wave with two different polarization constitute two different paths.
	- This provide only two different diversity branches. Polarization Diversity uses half power by dividing the power between two different polarized antennas.
