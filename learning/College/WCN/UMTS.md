### **UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System)**

- 3rd generation mobile technology designed for GSM networks.
- It is a third generation communication technology developed based on 3GPP standards.
- It operates using a broad radio spectrum allowing for faster data transfer speeds.


### **Working of UMTS**

1. **Core network architecture**
	- *User Equipment (UE)*: These are the mobile devices (like smartphones) used by subscribers.
	- *Access Network*: This includes base stations and controllers (Radio Network Controllers or RNCs).
	- *Core Network*: Manages call routing, authentication, and other services.

2. **WCDMA(Wide Code Division Multiple Access)**
	- Allows multiple users to share the same frequency band simultaneously.
	- Unlike GSM which utilizes a mix of FDMA and TDMA.

3. **Packet-Switched System**
    - UMTS relies on a packet-switched system, where cellular devices send small “packets” of data to a destination.
    - This is different from circuit-switched networks, which require a dedicated point-to-point connection for voice calls.
    - The packet-switched approach allows efficient data transfer and better utilization of network resources.

### **Advantages**

- Higher Information rates at lower incremental costs.
- UMTS could be a successor to 2G based GSM advances counting GPRS and EDGE . Gaining a 3rd title 3GSM since it could be a 3G relocation for GSM

### **Disadvantages of UMTS**

- It is more expensive than GSM.
- Universal Mobile Telecommunication System has poor video experience.
