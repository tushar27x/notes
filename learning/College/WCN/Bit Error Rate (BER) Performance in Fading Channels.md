BER is a critical metric in wireless communication which indicate the rate at which error occurs in a transmitted bit stream.

Fading channels have a significant impact on BER because they introduce fluctuations in signal amplitude, leading to incorrect decoding of bits.

**BER in Rayleigh Fading**:

- Since thereâ€™s no dominant LOS, Rayleigh fading causes severe fluctuations, leading to higher BER.
- BER performance in Rayleigh fading is improved by techniques such as diversity schemes, forward error correction, and adaptive modulation.

**BER in Ricean Fading**:

- The presence of an LOS component helps reduce deep fades, resulting in a lower BER compared to Rayleigh fading.
- Ricean fading generally provides better BER performance due to the more stable received signal.
