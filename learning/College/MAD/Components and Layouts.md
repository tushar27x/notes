- **UI Components**: These include buttons, checkboxes, sliders, input fields, cards, icons, and navigation bars. Each component has a unique role in facilitating interaction and communication within the app.
	- **Buttons**: Facilitate actions like “submit” or “cancel.”
	- **Input Fields**: Allow data entry, such as text or number inputs.
	- **Icons**: Represent actions, features, or information graphically (e.g., home, settings).

- **Layouts**: Layouts define how components are organized on the screen and are crucial in maintaining a visually appealing structure. They adapt based on screen size, orientation, and user needs.
	- **Grid Layouts**: Use a grid to structure elements, maintaining alignment and proportion.
	- **List Layouts**: Typically used for displaying multiple items, such as messages in a chat app.
	- **Card Layouts**: Use "cards" to group related information or actions in a visually distinct manner. Cards often include an image, text, and interactive elements such as buttons. They are popular in dashboards, product listings, and content feeds.
    
- **Typography**: Typography encompasses the style, size, and layout of text in the interface. Proper typography ensures readability, hierarchy, and visual harmony.
    - **Headings**: Define the main sections or titles, usually larger and more prominent.
    - **Body Text**: The main content text, designed for readability at smaller sizes.
    - **Labels**: Brief text that identifies form fields, buttons, or other interactive elements.

- **Color Scheme**: A consistent color palette improves aesthetics and usability by guiding user focus and reinforcing branding.
    - **Primary Colors**: Used for prominent actions, such as buttons or key highlights.
    - **Secondary Colors**: Complement the primary colors, often used for backgrounds or less prominent elements.
    - **Neutral Colors**: Used for backgrounds, borders, and text to provide contrast and balance.
      
- **Animations and Transitions**: Animations add life to the interface by providing visual feedback and guiding the user’s focus.
    - **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations triggered by user actions (e.g., button clicks, hover effects).
    - **Page Transitions**: Smooth animations when navigating between screens or sections.
    - **Loading Indicators**: Visual cues like spinners or progress bars to communicate ongoing processes.

- **Accessibility Features**: Design considerations to ensure usability for all users, including those with disabilities.
    - **Screen Reader Support**: Ensuring all components are labeled and accessible for screen readers.
    - **Keyboard Navigation**: Allowing users to interact using keyboard shortcuts.
    - **Contrast and Font Size**: Meeting standards for text visibility and contrast ratios.
    
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app functions well across various devices and screen sizes.
    - **Breakpoints**: Define the thresholds for adapting layouts between screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
    - **Flexible Components**: Components adjust dynamically to fit the available space while maintaining usability.
    - **Touch Targets**: Ensuring interactive elements are appropriately sized for touch input on smaller devices.
