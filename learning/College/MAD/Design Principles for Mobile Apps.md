These principles prioritize the user’s experience, ensuring that they can easily navigate and interact with the app.

- ***Simplicity***: Keep the design simple and uncluttered. Users should be able to understand the functionality quickly without excessive elements that could distract or confuse.
  
- ***Consistency***: Elements like buttons, colors, fonts, and navigation styles should be consistent throughout the app. This builds a predictable and comfortable experience.
  
- ***Feedback***: Give users immediate feedback on their actions (e.g., button press changes color when clicked, loading spinners show progress). Feedback reassures the user that the app is responsive to their interactions.
  
- ***Visibility***: Make important elements and functions easily accessible and visible. The primary actions should be prominent, while less-used features should take a back seat.
  
- ***Affordance***: UI elements should indicate how they’re supposed to be used. For example, buttons should look pressable, and sliders should look movable.
  
- ***Accessibility***: Make the design usable for people with various abilities by considering color contrast, text size, and screen reader compatibility.
