- Progressive Web Applications
- Progressive web apps are essentially a website which runs locally on your device.
- The technologies used are React, Angular JS, etc. The apps’ UI is developed the same way as they are developed while developing the website.


**Advantages of Progressive web Application:** 

1. The main advantage of this process is that its development speed is fast the same code base is used for IOS, Android, web applications.
2. The web development team can be repurposed to develop the mobile application.
3. No installation required.

**Disadvantages** **of Progressive web Application:** 

1. The major disadvantage is that PWA don’t have access to all the feature and so the user experience is not that good 
2. IOS does not support all the features of PWA  
3. The UI for development is bespoke i.e. the buttons, edit texts need to be programmed which was not necessary for the 1st party native Apps.
4. The community is not that wide spread.
5. No extra room for business model i.e. it is still a challenge to develop a revenue model or advertising opportunities for PWAs. At the moment, there are fewer options than among native apps to subscribe to.
