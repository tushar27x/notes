- These are frameworks that allow developing total native applications which have access to all the native features of IOS and Android but with the same code base.
- These apps run on both Android and IOS. So normally the development speeds of these apps are very fast and the maintenance cost is low. The performance speed is comparatively low to 1st party native apps but faster than PWA.
- React Native is Facebook’s cross-platform solution which uses the language JavaScript And the preferred IDE Visual Studio Code.
- Flutter is Google’s cross-platform solution which uses the language, Dart. The IDE preferred is Android Studio, IntelliJ IDE, and Visual Studio Code.

**Advantages of Cross-Platform Application:**  

1. The apps’ development speed is very high as they use the same code base for both Android and IOS.
2. The apps’ maintenance cost is low as the errors and updates as to be countered only once.

**Disadvantages** **of Cross-Platform Application:** 

1. Slow Code Performance With Limited Tool Availability.
2. Limited User Experience i.e. these apps does not have access to Native only features.
