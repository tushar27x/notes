Location-based services and mapping provide functionalities like GPS-based location tracking, map displays, and geofencing. These are essential for apps that depend on real-world locations, such as navigation, ride-sharing, and delivery services.

**GPS and Location Tracking**: This uses the device’s GPS to detect the user’s current location. In mobile apps, location tracking can be used for features like route planning, real-time tracking, and location-based reminders.
- **Geolocation APIs**: APIs from platforms like Google or Apple can retrieve the user’s latitude and longitude, which can then be used to display the location on a map.
- **Geofencing**: Setting up virtual boundaries around a physical area. When a user enters or exits a geofence, the app can trigger specific actions like notifications.

**Mapping and Visualization**:
- **Map Integration**: Integrating maps from services like Google Maps or Apple Maps allows the app to visually display locations, routes, and other data.
- **Route Optimization**: Useful for delivery or navigation apps, this involves calculating the best route between two points, often using algorithms provided by mapping services.
- **Location-Based Recommendations**: Apps can use the user’s location to provide relevant information, like nearby restaurants, gas stations, or stores.
