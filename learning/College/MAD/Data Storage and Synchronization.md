Data storage and synchronization ensure that mobile apps can manage data, even offline, and keep it consistent across multiple devices or sessions.

**Types of Data Storage**:

- **Local Storage**: Storing data directly on the device. Common methods include:
    - **Shared Preferences**: For simple key-value data, like user settings or preferences.
    - **SQLite Database**: For structured data, ideal for apps that need relational data storage on the device.
    - **File Storage**: For storing files like images or PDFs.
- **Remote Storage**: Storing data on cloud-based servers, allowing access across devices and locations.

**Data Synchronization**: Keeping data consistent between local storage and the server.

- **Offline Mode**: Allows users to access and manipulate data offline. Changes are stored locally and synchronized with the server once connectivity is restored.
- **Sync Mechanisms**: These can include techniques like real-time data updates with Web Sockets or periodic syncing using background tasks.
