With mobile devices, screens vary widely in size and resolution. Designers must ensure their interfaces adapt and look good across various devices, from small phones to large tablets.

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts the layout based on the screen size and orientation. This can be done by using flexible grid layouts, scalable UI elements, and breakpoints where the layout adapts for different screen sizes.
- **Adaptive Design**: Rather than one flexible layout, adaptive design creates different layouts for different screen sizes. This allows for more tailored designs but requires more work to implement.
- **Pixel Density**: Consider that devices with higher resolutions (like “Retina” screens) may need higher-resolution assets or adjustments in font size to look clear and crisp.
- **Screen Ratios**: Account for devices with different aspect ratios, such as the 16:9 aspect ratio on many phones versus the 4:3 on some tablets.
