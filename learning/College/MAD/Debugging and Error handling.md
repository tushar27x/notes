Effective debugging and error handling are essential for delivering a robust app. Key points include:

#### a. Debugging Techniques

- **Logging:** Use logs to track app execution and identify errors.    
    - Tools: Logcat (Android), Console (iOS).
- **Breakpoints:** Pause app execution at specific lines to inspect variable values.
    - Tools: Android Studio Debugger, Xcode.
- **Crash Reports:** Analyze crash logs to pinpoint issues.
    - Tools: Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry.
- **Unit Tests:** Write and run tests to isolate and identify faulty code.

#### b. Error Handling Best Practices

- **Graceful Degradation:** Handle errors without disrupting the user experience.
- **User Feedback:** Display meaningful error messages instead of technical jargon.
- **Retries and Fallbacks:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient issues.
- **Validation:** Validate user inputs to prevent crashes. 
- **Exception Handling:** Catch and handle exceptions appropriately.
    - Example: `try-catch` blocks in Java/Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS.
