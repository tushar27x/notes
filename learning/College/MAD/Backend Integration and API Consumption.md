Backend integration and API consumption allow mobile apps to interact with remote servers to fetch, send, and process data.

**Backend Integration**: The backend (server-side) handles data processing, authentication, business logic, and database interactions. A well-integrated backend enables efficient communication between the app and server.

- **RESTful APIs**: Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources on the server, and are commonly used for web and mobile backend integration.
- **GraphQL**: An alternative to REST, GraphQL allows the app to query only the data it needs, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving performance.

**API Consumption**: APIs expose specific data and functionalities to the app. The app consumes these APIs to retrieve data (like user profiles) or perform actions (like payments).

- **OAuth for Authentication**: OAuth tokens allow apps to securely access user data on behalf of the user, which is common in apps that use social login or third-party services.
- **Error Handling and Security**: Secure API communication often involves encrypting requests with HTTPS and handling errors (e.g., retries for network errors or feedback on failed requests).
