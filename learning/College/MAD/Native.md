- Apps are developed for a native software.
- Applications designed to run on iOS will only be able to run on iOS devices, same goes of other OS.
- These apps cannot be used on different devices using a different OS.


#### Example 
A retail company wants to improve the in-store shopping experience for its customers. They develop a 1st party native app that allows customers to:

- Browse the store’s inventory and product information
- Create a shopping list
- Scan barcodes to view product information and reviews
- Locate items in the store using an interactive map
- Pay for items directly through the app, without having to wait in line at the register
- The app is only available to the company’s customers and can only be used in their physical stores. The app is designed to integrate with the company’s existing systems, such as inventory management and point-of-sale systems.

This app is developed by the retail company for their own use, to improve the in-store customer experience, increase sales and gain insights from the customer’s behavior.

In this example, the retail company is the 1st party, and the app is a native app, because it is developed for the specific platform (iOS or Android) and can take full advantage of the device’s capabilities and features.

#### Tools for development

The tools required for development of native apps are 
- Android Studio for android
- XCode for iOS and mac


#### Advantages

1.  The performances of these apps are very high these apps very fast compared to any other apps.
2.  We have easy access to all the features and APIs.
3.  The community is widespread so all your doubts and errors can be discussed and solved easily.
4.  Updates are available on the same day.

#### Disadvantages

1. The development speed is too slow as we have to code it again for different OS.
2.  And this category doesn’t support open source.
