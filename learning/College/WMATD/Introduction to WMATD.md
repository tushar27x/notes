- Testing and deployment are critical phases in SDLC that ensures and application functions correctly, meets users expectation and perform well in various environments.
- Web and mobile applications require unique testing and deployment strategies due to differences in platforms, user interactions, network conditions, and device constraints.

### **Importance of Testing and Deployment in the Software Development Lifecycle**

- **Quality Assurance**: Testing identifies bugs, performance bottlenecks, and security issues, ensuring the application meets quality standards.
- **User Satisfaction**: A well-tested application is more reliable, secure, and user-friendly, leading to higher user satisfaction and retention.
- **Reduced Maintenance Costs**: Early detection of issues reduces future costs related to bug fixes and updates.
- **Efficient Deployment**: Proper deployment strategies ensure a smooth release, reducing downtime and enabling seamless updates or rollbacks.
- **Product Reliability and Stability**: Effective deployment minimizes errors and guarantees the applicationâ€™s availability and stability in production environments.
