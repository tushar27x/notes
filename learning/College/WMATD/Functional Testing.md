- It is a type of black box testing that verifies application behaves as expected.
- focuses on testing the functionality of the software components by providing inputs and validating the outputs against expected results.

- **Purpose** -> Functional testing evaluates specific functions and features of the application. For example, logging in, submitting a form, or navigating between pages.

- **Scope** -> Focuses on what the application does (i.e., its functionality), not how it achieves that functionality.

- **Process**
	-  Identify functional requirements.
	- Create test cases based on these requirements.
	- Execute test cases by providing inputs and observing outputs.
	- Compare actual results with expected outcomes to identify any discrepancies.

#### Types of Functional Testing for Web and Mobile Applications:

1. **Unit Testing:**
    - Tests individual components or modules of the app.
    - Ensures that each module performs its intended function.
2. **Smoke Testing:**
    - Verifies that the most crucial functionalities of the app work.
    - Acts as a preliminary check before further testing.
3. **Sanity Testing:**
    - Checks specific functionality or bug fixes to confirm they work as expected.
4. **Integration Testing:**
    - Tests the interaction between different modules or components of the app.
    - Ensures data flow between modules works correctly.
5. **System Testing:**
    - Tests the app as a whole to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
    - Validates end-to-end scenarios.
6. **Acceptance Testing:**
    - Performed to verify the app meets business requirements.
    - Includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to confirm the appâ€™s readiness for release.
