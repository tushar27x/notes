### **Methodologies**

- **Manual Testing** -> Testers manually execute test cases without automation. Manual testing is ideal for exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc testing, but it is time-consuming.

- **Automated Testing** -> Automated scripts run repetitive test cases, making it faster and more efficient for regression and load testing. Common tools include Selenium for web applications and Appium for mobile apps.

- **Black box testing** -> focuses on testing applications without the knowledge of its internal code.

- **White box testing** -> examines internal code structure and logic of the application code, often performed by developers and testers with coding knowledge.

- **Gray box testing** -> A combination of black-box and white-box testing, where testers have limited knowledge of the code.

### **Strategies**

- **Functional Testing** -> Validates that the application performs its intended functions correctly. This includes unit, integration, system and acceptance testing.

- **Performance Testing** -> Measures how well the application performs under various loads and network conditions. Types include load, stress, scalability, and endurance testing

- **Usability Testing** -> Assesses the user-friendliness of the application, especially important for mobile apps that require seamless user experience on small screens.

- **Compatibility Testing** -> Verifies that the application works correctly across different browsers, operating systems, and devices.

- **Security Testing** -> Checks for vulnerabilities, ensuring data privacy, and safeguarding against threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and unauthorized access.

- **Regression Testing** -> Ensures that new code doesn't negatively impact the existing features.

- **User Acceptance Testing** -> Conducted by end-users to ensure the application meets their requirements and performs as expected in real-world scenarios.
