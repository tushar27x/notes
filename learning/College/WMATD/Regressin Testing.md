**Regression Testing** is a type of software testing aimed at ensuring that recent changes or updates to the codebase have not introduced defects or adversely affected the existing functionality. It is essential to maintain the stability and quality of software during its lifecycle.

### **Key Objectives of Regression Testing**

1. **Verify Stability**: Ensure new features or bug fixes do not disrupt existing functionality.
2. **Detect Side Effects**: Identify unintended changes introduced by modifications.
3. **Maintain Quality**: Confirm that software continues to perform as expected after updates.
4. **Support Continuous Integration**: Facilitate rapid and reliable delivery in Agile and DevOps environments.

### **When to Perform Regression Testing**

1. **After Code Changes**:
    - Adding new features or fixing bugs.
2. **During Enhancements**:
    - Modifying existing features for improvements.
3. **Post Integration**:
    - Combining new modules with existing ones.
4. **Before Major Releases**:
    - Final validation to ensure system stability.

### **Types of Regression Testing**

1. **Corrective Regression Testing**:
    - Performed when no significant changes are made to the code, focusing on verifying existing functionality.
2. **Retest-All Regression Testing**:
    - Re-executes all test cases in the suite to ensure overall system stability.
    - Resource-intensive and typically used for critical applications.
3. **Selective Regression Testing**:
    - Runs only a subset of relevant test cases based on code changes.
    - Saves time and resources while maintaining effectiveness.
4. **Progressive Regression Testing**:
    - Conducted when new test cases are added to ensure the updated test suite doesn't impact existing functionality.
5. **Complete Regression Testing**:
    - Performed after multiple changes or when the system undergoes significant updates.
6. **Partial Regression Testing**:
    - Focuses on the areas impacted by the code changes and their dependencies.

### **Steps in Regression Testing**

1. **Identify Changes**:
    - Analyze code changes to determine which parts of the application are affected.
2. **Select Test Cases**:
    - Prioritize critical test cases and those related to the modified functionality.
3. **Set Up the Test Environment**:
    - Mimic the production environment for accurate results.
4. **Execute Test Cases**:
    - Run the selected test cases manually or using automation tools.
5. **Analyze Results**:
    - Compare test results with expected outcomes and identify defects.
6. **Report and Fix Issues**:
    - Document any bugs and collaborate with developers for resolution.
7. **Re-Test and Validate**:
    - Re-run tests to confirm fixes and validate overall stability.

### **Automating Regression Testing**

Automation is highly recommended for regression testing due to its repetitive nature. Automated testing can save time, reduce costs, and improve accuracy.

1. **Create Automated Test Scripts**:
    - Use tools like Selenium, Cypress, or TestNG for web applications, Appium for mobile apps, and Postman for API testing.
2. **Implement Test Frameworks**:
    - Use frameworks such as Page Object Model (POM) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for better script management.
3. **Schedule Tests in CI/CD Pipelines**:
    - Integrate tests with Jenkins, GitLab, or other CI/CD tools for continuous testing.
4. **Maintain Test Scripts**:
    - Regularly update scripts to align with application changes.

### **Choosing Test Cases for Regression Testing**

1. **Critical Features**:
    - Core functionalities like user login, payment processing, or data submission.
2. **Frequently Used Features**:
    - High-priority areas accessed often by users.
3. **Recently Modified Areas**:
    - Modules impacted by recent code changes.
4. **Defect-Prone Areas**:
    - Parts of the application with a history of bugs.
5. **Integration Points**:
    - Interfaces between different modules or third-party integrations.
