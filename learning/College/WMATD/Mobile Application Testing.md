- **Functional Testing**: Validates core features like navigation, input fields, and buttons to ensure that the app’s functionality aligns with requirements.
- **UI/UX Testing**: Checks the usability and user experience of the application, focusing on the app’s layout, ease of navigation, and visual design.
- **Performance Testing**: Tests the app's speed, responsiveness, and stability under different conditions (e.g., varying network speeds, battery conditions, memory usage).
- **Network Testing**: Examines how the app performs with different network conditions, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi, and how it handles interruptions (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to cellular).
- **Interrupt Testing**: Ensures the app handles interruptions gracefully, such as incoming calls, notifications, or low battery alerts.
- **Security Testing**: Identifies potential vulnerabilities like data leaks, weak authentication mechanisms, and unauthorized access.
- **Localization Testing**: Verifies that the app is correctly adapted for different languages, regions, and cultural norms.
