- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
- By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
- Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
